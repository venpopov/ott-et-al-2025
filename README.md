Some (re)-analyses of data shated by Ott et al (2024) Better Source Memory for Remembered To-Be-Forgotten Items Than for Remembered To-Be-Remembered Items. JEP:LMC.

I retrieved the original code and data from the [OSF link](https://osf.io/mg8ed/?view_only=f24217324e8b4bf887205b6932f40788) that was shared in the paper. The first commit contains the code and data exactly as it was on OSF on Feb 4, 2025.

Any subsequent analyses and results are not associated with the authors and are just for my exploration.
